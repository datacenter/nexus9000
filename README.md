Nexus 9000 Community GitHub
=====================

Welcome to the GitHub Community for Nexus 9000.  This site is intended as a place for any users of Cisco Application-Centric Infrastructure (ACI) or NX-OS to share code and learn to build solutions.  While many of the initial contributions were created by Cisco employees, ANYONE is allowed and in fact encouraged to participate and share code.  Pull requests are monitored and reviewed by a group of administrators to maintain a level of quality and protect users consuming code as well.    

The site is structured into two sections:

- NX-OS: Focuses on the Nexus 9000 series of switches running enhanced Nexus OS.  These products include NX-API, Puppet, Chef, and shell scripts.  
- ACI: Focuses on the APIC and ACI Object Model.  This will include python, Puppet, and Chef.  Additioanlly, it will include application profiles, which are XML-based configurations that model applications, and southbound device automation scripts, which can be used to integrate 3rd party L4-7 devices.
