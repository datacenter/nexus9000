N9K Remote Python 

The Nexus 9000 family switches provide python objects to access switch resources. The python objects are on the switch. One can run python scripts using the objects on the switch. At the same time, we provide the capability to utilize the python objects off the switch based on NXAPI. 

Please note, the python objects on the switch access switch resources in two ways: access through cli and access through native library. We replaced the python objects that access resources through cli with NXAPI as underneath transport. For those python objects that access through native libraries, off-box is NOT supported yet.

Install instructions:
1. Make sure nxapi is running on your switch.
  
  SWITCH-1# conf
  SWITCH-1(config)# feature nxapi
  SWITCH-1(config)# show nxapi
  nxapi enabled
  Listen on port 80
  Listen on port 443

2. Obtain the Python objects in the "cisco" directory and make it a subdirectory of remote_client.  (This code will be coming to Github soon).  

Option 1: Copy them directly off the switch directly from /isan/python/scripts/cisco.  

Option 2: Download them from Cisco Developer Network.  http://developer.cisco.com/web/n9k/downloads 

3. See client_example.py for an example.
