NX-API: exposes CLIs that traditionally run on the switch to the outside of the switch through HTTP/HTTPs. It is an extension to the existing CLI System on N9K. NX-API supports show commands, configurations as well as linux bash.

One can access the NXAPI through the following steps:
1. Do feature nxapi to enable NXAPI
2. Access the NXAPI sandbox page by pointing your browser to https://{mgmt-ip}
3. Refer to Documentation link for more info

We provide sample usages of NXAPI. The NXAPI sandbox page is expected to serve only as sandbox trying out the API and quickly check the API output. Users are expected to write easy scripts utilizing the HTTP transport.

The utils folder contains easy-to-use utility to use NXAPI
