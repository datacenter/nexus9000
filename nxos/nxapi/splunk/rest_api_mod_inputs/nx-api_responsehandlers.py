""" nx-api_responsehandlers.py - a custom response handler for Cisco's NX-API
    to handle the nxapi_auth cookie to ensure that the cookie is saved from
    the response so it can be persisted to the next request.  Must be used in
    conjunction with a custom authentication handler that then retrieves the
    cookie and sends it.

    This is accomplished by saving the cookie in a cookie file in the
    (hopefully) platform agnostic way using the tempfile module to do a 
    tempfile.gettempdir() then create or overwrite a file in that directory
    that is specifically named the same as the REST API action configured on
    the splunk server.

    The required custom response handler configuration in the Rest API action
    data input is as follows:

        Custom Response Handler: NxApiResponseHandler
        Custom Authentication Handler Arguments:
           name=<name> 

     Where:

         :param name: A unique name for the Rest API action configured as a
             data input, the common practice is to set this to the "Rest API
             Input Name" and this must match the name from the "Custom
             Authentication Handler Arguments" configuration. 

    This response handler should be merged into:
        rest_ta/bin/responsehandlers.py

    Tested with Splunk version 6.0 & Rest API Modular Input v1.3.2

        file in the temporary directory with the same filename of "name"
        where name is the name of the Rest API action that is running on
        the splunk server.

        In order for this to work completely there has to be a
        corresponding custom authentication handler that then utilizes that
        saved cookie.
